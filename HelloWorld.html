            Hello My Dear freind, This is a letter to you. The current time is 1:17 in the night. I am feeling so much lonely sometimes.
            My dad's health is not good . He seems bit restless, I am not able to focus on my work as well, my stress is getting busted out.
            I need to focus in a good way for myself. For my health, else I would not physcially fit. 
            Take care my friend. Your health is your ownership only. No one is going to come to save you.
            Negative thoughts are coming in my head due to the all the mess has been created
